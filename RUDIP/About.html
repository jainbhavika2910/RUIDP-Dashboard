                  RUIDP (Rajasthan Urban Infrastructure Development Project), backed by ADB funding, targets enhancement of urban services across key cities, including Jodhpur .In Jodhpur, the focus spans water supply, sewerage, drainage, roads, and solid waste management to improve living conditions, boost public health, and support environmental resilience .The Rajasthan Urban Infrastructure Development Project (RUIDP) encompasses a comprehensive approach to modernizing urban infrastructure across Rajasthan’s cities. One of its major components is Water Supply Projects, which include laying new pipelines, installing pumps, and constructing reservoirs to ensure a continuous and reliable 24x7 water supply in selected urban zones. Another crucial area is Sewerage and Drainage Systems, which involve expanding sewer networks, building Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs), and implementing stormwater drainage solutions to prevent urban flooding during the monsoon season. Under Roads and Urban Transport, the project undertakes road widening, construction of flyovers, and junction improvements to enhance connectivity between residential and commercial areas, reducing congestion and improving mobility.Finally, the project emphasizes Institutional Reforms and Capacity Building by offering training programs for Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) and supporting systems for e-governance, financial management, and improved service delivery. Together, these integrated efforts aim to create cleaner, more efficient, and resilient urban environments across Rajasthan.
